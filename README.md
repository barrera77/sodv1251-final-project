# sodv1251-final-project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple airline ticket reservation page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. The project will consist of three main parts:

1. **Design a simple HTML page** with a form to allow users to input their email address and flight date and reserve a ticket.
2. **Use JavaScript** to add functionality to the form to allow users to select a round-trip flight and enter a return date.
3. **Write an Express app** to serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files created in parts 1 and 2 and create an endpoint to handle the submission of the reservation ticket.

# The Improvements

1. Ceate a single page application simulating an airline booking system (As much as possible) staying within technology requirments. The user should be abler to provide all information as in real life, register and login

2. Get flights information in real time using an API or google scrapper
3. Add log in feature
4. Add Register feature
5. Add autocomplete fields (using either data from tables or an API)
6. Add a database (MSSQL)
7. Encrypt new user passwords
8. Deploy with Docker


### Technologies used
- Node.js
- Bootstrap
- JS
- Express
- MSSQL
- jQuery
- Nodemailer
- Passport
- Multer
- Bcrypt
- Docker

## What I learned:
- Full stack development: Building a full-stack application from scratch using JavaScript and Node.js, without relying on frameworks, allowed me to gain a deep understanding of how the front-end and back-end components interact and function together.

- Front-end design and layout: I learned how to create visually appealing user interfaces using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

- State Management: I gained experience in managing application state by implementing an abstract class as a template, which provided a structured and reusable approach to handling state across different components.

- RESTful API design: I learned how to design and implement a RESTful API using Express, defining clear routes and endpoints to facilitate communication between the client and server.

- Deployment: I learned how to utilize Docker for application deployment, creating containerized environments to ensure consistency across different systems. This method simplified the deployment process and provided me with a great tool to improve the applicationâ€™s flexibility and reliability.

## Conclusion

Through this experience, I developed a solid foundation in full-stack development, from designing user interfaces to implementing back-end functionality and deploying applications. Each aspect of the project provided me with valuable insights and practical skills, reinforcing my understanding of modern web development practices.  Each skill contributed to my understanding of building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. The experience of working without frameworks, leveraging abstract classes for state management, and deploying with Docker has provided me with a strong foundation to deal with complex software development challenges.
